 ## 1. Project Overview
Space Invaders is a classic arcade game from the 80s. The player aims to shoot laser beams at the invading alien armada, before it reaches the planet's surface using a mounted gun turret. The player can only move left or right. The aliens also move from left to right, and also move down each time they reach the side of the screen. The aliens also periodically drop bombs towards the player.

I wanted to create a similar game but sought to modernise it by using better images for the spaceship and aliens and laser beams. The aim was to create the nostalgic feel for the game but with better graphics and music.
